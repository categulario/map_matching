My implementation of the map matching algorithm from `this article <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308856380_Fast_Hidden_Markov_Model_Map-Matching_for_Sparse_and_Noisy_Trajectories>`_ (Althought with some modifications). The goal is to get the streets from a gps track.

This is how it looks like:

   :alt: Output of the example run

The gray line is the gps trace and the colored lines describe the map-matched most-likely route in the streets for the vehicle.

For reference read `the resulting article <https://categulario.tk/mapmatching.pdf>`_.

Setup
-----

You'll need python 3.5+ and a redis server running. The usage of a virtual environment is recommended.

Install from pypi:

.. code:: bash

   $ pip install mapmatching

Or install from source:

.. code:: bash

   $ cd mapmatching
   $ python setup.py install

Usage
-----

Download data from OpenStreetMaps:

.. code:: bash

   $ mapmatching download -h
   $ mapmatching download -96.99107360839844 19.441181182861328 -96.846435546875 19.59616470336914 -o streets.json

And load it to redis, by default it loads it to database 1 instead of redis default of 0.

.. code:: bash

   $ mapmatching load streets.json

The two previous commands can be chained:

.. code:: bash

   $ mapmatching download -96.99107360839844 19.441181182861328 -96.846435546875 19.59616470336914 | mapmatching load

Then run the match task with a geojson file with a single gps track. A sample track that works with the sample bounding box is contained in the ``data/`` directory of the repository.

.. code:: bash

   $ mapmatching match -h
   $ mapmatching match data/route.geojson -o output.json

Optionally visualize it in the browser:

.. code:: bash

   $ pip install geojsonio
   $ geojsonio output.json
